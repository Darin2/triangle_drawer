# Triangle Drawer

Triangle Drawer is a simple interactive web application built with p5.js that allows users to create colorful triangles on a canvas. When you click and hold your mouse button, the application draws green triangles at your cursor position. This project demonstrates basic p5.js functionality including canvas creation, mouse interaction, and shape drawing.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Click and hold your mouse button anywhere on the canvas
3. Move your mouse while holding the button to create triangles in different positions
4. Release the mouse button to stop drawing triangles

No installation or setup is required - just download the files and open the HTML file to start creating your triangle art!
